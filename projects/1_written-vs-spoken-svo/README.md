# Project 1 — Written vs Spoken SVO (Slovenian → SyntaxFest)

> Project 1 of the [UD-WALS-Linguistic-Patterns](../../README.md) repository.
> All paths below are relative to this folder, `projects/1_written-vs-spoken-svo/`.
> This is one evolving research line: it began as a WALS→UD feature-mapping
> course project, narrowed to **written-vs-spoken SVO word order** in Slovenian,
> and was then extended with more corpora for the SyntaxFest article/poster
> (plus the resulting paper drafts and post-SyntaxFest analyses). The follow-up
> that reuses the same method for **human-vs-AI** text is
> [project 2](../2_human-vs-ai-svo/).

## Overview

This project began as part of a university course, the [*Digital Linguistics Project*](https://theta.ffzg.hr/ECTS/Predmet/Index/35946) at the Faculty of Social Sciences and Humanities, University of Zagreb. It documents and explores linguistic patterns using Universal Dependencies (UD) and the World Atlas of Language Structures (WALS).

The project was divided into two phases:
1. **Phase 1**: Contribution to a broader Slovenian linguistic project, involving the creation of a table mapping WALS features to UD queries.
2. **Phase 2**: An independent analysis focusing on word order patterns in Slovenian, comparing written and spoken corpora.

It serves as a transparent record of the work, including data processing scripts, [analysis results](#results-word-order-analysis), and relevant documentation.

## Repository Structure

Shared analysis pipeline at the top; the phase-specific deliverables are split
into `course/` (Zagreb course) and `syntaxfest/` (the 2025 article).

### Source corpora

The written and spoken corpora are the public Universal Dependencies Slovenian
treebanks ([UD_Slovenian-SSJ](https://github.com/UniversalDependencies/UD_Slovenian-SSJ),
written; [UD_Slovenian-SST](https://github.com/UniversalDependencies/UD_Slovenian-SST),
spoken). The `.conllu` files in `data/src/` are gitignored; to recreate them,
download the treebanks and run the preprocessing chain
`sl_ssj-ud.conllu` → (`scripts/2_fix_and_validate_conllu.py`) → `fixed_…` →
(`scripts/3_remove_punct_conllu.py`) → `cleaned_…` (the file STARK extracts from).

## Results: Word Order Analysis

The quantitative study conducted as part of this project reveals key differences in word order patterns between spoken and written Slovenian:

- **Written Corpus (SSJ)**:
  - Strong preference for SVO (Subject-Verb-Object), reflecting the structured syntax typical of written language and aligning with the WALS value for Slovenian.
- **Spoken Corpus (SST)**:
  - Greater variation, with word orders such as SOV, OSV, and OVS appearing more often.

### Interpretation
- Written language prioritizes unmarked SVO for clarity and consistency.
- Spoken language is more flexible, using varied word orders to emphasize topics or structure information.
- These findings highlight the adaptability of spoken syntax and the influence of pragmatics on word order, emphasizing the need to revisit and update outdated WALS feature values.

### Outputs
Visualizations and analysis results are available in `results/` (figures, summary
tables, and the `results/analysis/` comparison spreadsheets). The SyntaxFest paper
materials are in `syntaxfest/paper/`; the earlier course draft is `course/paper_v1.pdf`.
